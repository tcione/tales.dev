[[#vaughn-ddddis](/tags/vaughn-ddddis)], on 1st chapter:

SCRUM is all about knowledge acquisition. It comes from the assumption that we cannot know enough about a project before we actually start it. Thus we design[1], we plan, we implement and we iterate based on newfound knowledge.

On a personal observation: SCRUM kind of clicked to me when reading that. However I should stay aware of SCRUM limitations. To me is much more a tactic than a strategy[2]
