Perell comments that there are 2 types of writing:
1. You have a clear thesis
2. You have a foggy intuition

This strategy is to help with the later. It consists the following flow:

1. Write your islands separately. That way you map your ideas
2. Arrange them in an order that makes sense to you (probably after getting insight from forming the islands)
3. Create bridges between the islands (make them as long as needed)

Note that this is good for open ended works. When you know what you want to say, please consider [202106231334 Summary box for writting](/blips/202106231334-summary-box-for-writting)
