On [[#stanier-effective-manager](/tags/stanier-effective-manager)], 2nd chapter:

A manager should spend time in activities that should be classifiable as:

- Information gathering
- Decision making
- Nudging (meaning participating in things that lead to decision making from others)
- Being a role model

As a personal note, I'd like to add that it is also important to ensure that your team is productive (would that be considered *nudging*? Not sure...)
