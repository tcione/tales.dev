On [[#stanier-effective-manager](/tags/stanier-effective-manager)], 11th chapter, the author mentions that it's important to give some space to your team after a stressful project (see [1] and [2]).

Not only I'd agree, but I'd also add that this is a worthwhile concept to carry throughout life: chill after stressful stuff.

On any scope:
- Celebrate your achievements, this marks a good moment and creates a nice memory
- Reflect on what happened and how one can improve

On a manager's scope:
- Leave space for your team to do self-directed project or minor tasks
- Pick up less visible things for some time

On a personal scope:
- Be content and grateful
