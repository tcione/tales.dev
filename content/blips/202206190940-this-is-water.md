"This is water" ([full transcript and audio]) is a remarkable speech done by David Foster Wallace. The speech starts with a parable (paraphrased by me):

> The older fish crosses two younger fish talking. This older fish then says "how's the water today?". After the senior swimmer is gone, one of remaining fish asks the other "what the hell is water?!"

The point is that the obvious if often not noticed. Mostly due to
"self-centeredness" or lack of awareness. This is main theme throughout the almost 23 minutes Wallace is talking.

One can extract some from the whole speech:

- You're not the center of the universe (even if your perspective says otherwise, due to experiencing the world from, well, your own perspective)
- Everyone has their inner world and their own issues. Do not assume they are just obstacles in your way
- Avoid petty thoughts when inconvenienced by things being what they are. Sort of connected to [202111111355 Worrying about things outside your control is wasted energy]. Wallace uses long lines as example. Why would you waste your time being annoyed at people?
