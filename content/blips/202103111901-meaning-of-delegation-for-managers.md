Managers delegate by definition. It is important to strike a balance between full control (you do everything yourself) and full delegation (fire and forget). Your judgment improves with deliberate practice.
However, some things to keep in mind:
- Delegate according to you staff's level. Always try to provide a challenger for them
- Decide on how much control to retain based on how critical the task is

Also remember not to:
- Let go of accountability (this is **abdication**, not delegation)
- Expect other to do things the way you do
- Take tasks back from people, **you must support them**
