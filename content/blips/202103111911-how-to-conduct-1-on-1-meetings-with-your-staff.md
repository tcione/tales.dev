It is important to have 1 on 1 meetings in a fixed scheduled and try as hard as you can not to skip those. Ideally, you do a thing called contracting [202103111916 About doing contracting with your staff](/blips/202103111916-about-doing-contracting-with-your-staff) in your first meeting and follow a routing for the next ones.
Keep in mind that these meetings are for your team members, so keep it focused on them and avoid plain status updates. Take the oppotunity to get a grasp of where they are, what they are struggling with, etc.
It is good practice to keep shared notes of the meetings with explored topics and actions points.

[[#stanier-effective-manager](/blips/tags/stanier-effective-manager)] has some suggestions on agenda, questions and topics in its 4th chapter. It might be worthwhile to consult there, if you're feeling lost.
