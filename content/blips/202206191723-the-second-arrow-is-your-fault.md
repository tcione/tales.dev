There is a Buddhist parable called "The Second Arrow of Suffering". The main idea is that we cannot avoid the first arrow, but the second is under our control, for it is the riple effects from the first one.

In other words, we must:

1. Notice the first hit, become aware of the feelings around it;
2. Try to accept those feelings and avoid damaging behavior (basically, "take a deep breath")
