The author suggests this to be done in two steps:
1. Foment team lightning talks (5min)
2. If those pick up, try department-wide talks (20/30min)

For this to succeed we need to be sure to a proper environment for talks. We should:
- Set a fixed time and cadence
- Set a rotation of people
- Take the first slot yourself to encourage your team in the future
- Make it enjoyable (not formal and loose on topics)
- Give incentives for providing feedback

As ideas go, the author suggests some topics:
- Show and tell
- Deep dives
- Success stories
- Horror stories
- Introduction to new tech
- Cultural and well-being elements
