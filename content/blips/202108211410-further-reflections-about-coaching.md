Reading [Julian Shapiro's Aug 20th highlights](https://www.julian.com/newsletter), I've came across some points that I'd like to remember about coaching:

- Coaching = strategical advice (and take stategy's strict meaning: [202105191401 Tactic VS Strategy](/blips/202105191401-tactic-vs-strategy))
- Two important questions to ask:
	1. How can I support you?
	2. What do you ultimately want?
- Make sure that you show that you have **high expectations** but also that you **have their backs**
