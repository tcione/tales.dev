[[#julian-defaults](/tags/julian-defaults)] gives a nicely packaged definition of network effects. Benefiting from **network effects** means that the system gets more valuable as it amasses *something*.

- **Direct network effects**: value comes from users
- **Indirect network effects**: value comes from groups of users attracting other groups of users. I.e.: developers bring more users (bc apps), and more users bring more developers (bc more money)
- **Data network effects**: value comes from the data generated by users
