[[#knowproj-pursuit-happiness](/tags/knowproj-pursuit-happiness)] is an episode focusing on happiness, which is incredibly vague, even though it's arguably one of the most important things in our like.

This is something I catch myself thinking about every so often, so I've decided to post take a few notes in the episode.

Things that nurture happiness:

- Social interaction (even when you don't feel like it)
- Joining a community
- Do stuff for other people (favors, donations, etc) – (my own note: as long as it doesn't harm you, be mindful)
- Do gratitude practices (list things you are grateful for in a diary or write gratitude letters to people)
- Try to be time affluent – lot's of grievances come from not having enough time ([#TODO](/tags/TODO) elaborate on time affluence)
  - Delegate chores, when possible
  - When grasping for time, don't cut the stuff that is important for your health and happiness like exercising, socializing, family time, etc
