[[#croce-slowdown](/blips/tags/croce-slowdown)] states something that gets obvious with experience, but it becomes a bit of a tacit knowledge. This makes it worthwhile to put in writing :)

Speed has its costs. Never sacrifice your health for anything. In the long term, slowing down will preserve yourself, your family, your users (from bugs), etc. Thus slowing down makes you faster.
