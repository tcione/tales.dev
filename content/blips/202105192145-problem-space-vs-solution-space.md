Problem space is where you define project drivers at a very high level. Think of it as Business Strategy[1]. Solution Space is where we apply [202105192137 Strategic Design around Domain Driven Design (DDD)](/blips/202105192137-strategic-design-around-domain-driven-design--ddd-) and its more closely related business tactics (again [1])

[202105192148 DDD - Bounded Contexts](/blips/202105192148-ddd---bounded-contexts) are great tools for the solution space
