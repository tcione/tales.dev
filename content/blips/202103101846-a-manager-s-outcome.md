On [[#stanier-effective-manager](/tags/stanier-effective-manager)], 2nd chapter:

A manager's outcome can be summarized as:
`team output + outcomes from influenced decisions`

It is important to mention that, at least from *my* perspective, team outcome includes a manager's work that is not strictly related to [202103101840 Meaning of productivity to a manager](/blips/202103101840-meaning-of-productivity-to-a-manager). I.e., working on technical concepts or some piece of code that makes sense for the manager to write.

At this point I'm unsure about how non-people related work fits in this productivity framework... ( [#todo](/tags/todo) review this )
