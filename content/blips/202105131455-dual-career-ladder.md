Also known as Y shaped. It describes the career path for professions that start in a single thread and then derive into two. The software development disciplines can serve as a good example:

```
						      _ Individual contributor (IC) track (LN + 1...LY)
                             /
Software developer (L1..LN) -
					         \_ Management track (LN + 1...LZ)
```

Both paths should have similar pay ranges. To get a bit more familiar with this example, go to [202105131506 About being an individual contributor versus being a manager](/blips/202105131506-about-being-an-individual-contributor-versus-being-a-manager)

It's worth mentioning that this might not be a one-way street: [202105131622 Engineering or Manager pendulum](/blips/202105131622-engineering-or-manager-pendulum)
