Having a team snapshot is useful to pin point discussion and improvement topics. Snapshots consist of the intersection between the your, your team and your manager observations.

- **Where all three meet:** alignment
- **Where you and your manager meet:** Poor communication downwards
- **Where you and your team meet:** Poor communication upwards
- **Where your manager and your team meet:** False beliefs

Snapshots are constructed by observing and having conversations with all sides here described.
