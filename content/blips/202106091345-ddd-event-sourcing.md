[[#vaughn-ddddis](/tags/vaughn-ddddis)], on 6th chapter:

Event sourcing is the act of persisting all [202106091344 DDD - Domain Events](/blips/202106091344-ddd---domain-events), so we can reconstitute a certain state based on those records.

There are probably strict performance requirements here, so be mindful of throughput and load when doing it.
