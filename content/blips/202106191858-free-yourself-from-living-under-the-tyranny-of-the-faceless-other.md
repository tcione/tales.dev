We're commonly oppressed by this imaginary audience and we shouldn't. We should get rid of this and listen to yourself. Write for yourself, compose for yourself, live for yourself, etc.

People who resonate will come, people who doesn't will just pass by, and that's fine.

Whatever you think other people is thinking of you, they probably aren't :)
