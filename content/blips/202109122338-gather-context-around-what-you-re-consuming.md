Got from [[#farnam-how-to-read](/tags/farnam-how-to-read)], but present in other places, like art analysis (of any kind). So I felt it was worthwhile to register.

Knowing in which context that piece of work was done can help you greatly into getting a deeper understanding, and also to be aware of the biases around that work.  After all [202109122343 Everything has a bias](/blips/202109122343-everything-has-a-bias). Being aware of it will enrich your experience.

So ask things like:
- How was the author's life at that point
- What was the historical context
- Etcetcetc
