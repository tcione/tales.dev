As grown ups, we tend to take things at face value. We get shaped into them. Resist that, life is not something to accept, but something to embrace.

To quote the video:
"Embrace it, change it, improve it, make your mark upon it"

Also, no need for grandiose stuff, remember that this can be done in small, personal ways.
