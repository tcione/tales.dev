Career frameworks ensure that career paths within a company are clear and that employees have actionable steps for moving between levels. Here are some common traits of career frameworks:

- Define formalized level numbers (I.e, L1 to LN)
- Levels should have similar salary ranges within the same disciplines (I.e, this should be the case in the example given here [202105131455 Dual career ladder](/blips/202105131455-dual-career-ladder))
- Offer development possibilities (again, see [202105131455 Dual career ladder](/blips/202105131455-dual-career-ladder) or [202105131506 About being an individual contributor versus being a manager](/blips/202105131506-about-being-an-individual-contributor-versus-being-a-manager))
- Define essential aspects for your company (i.e., "Impact", "Culture", "Expertise", "Influence", etc) as define expectations for these at each level
	- IMPORTANT: Try to not define too many :)
