[[#bailey-not-personal](/tags/bailey-not-personal)] enumerates some examples on what some negative reactions might indicate. **But the main take-away is to always question if that negative reaction comes from an unmet need.**

Some examples:
- Anxiety might come from lack of visibility
- Blaming might come from anger
- So forth and so on.

So whenever facing negative reactions, stop a minute to wonder about what has caused them and try to uncover the covert reason.
