According to [[#stanier-effective-manager](/tags/stanier-effective-manager)], motivation can be coded using [Maslow's hierarchy of needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs). From the bottom to the top:

1. Physicological: being paid fairly
2. Safety: job and psychological safety
3. Love/belonging: you want to work with people you like and admire. You also want to maintain good relationships with those people
4. Esteem: formal and informal recognition
5. Self-actualization: challenge and growth

It might be worthwhile reflecting on what those items mean to yourself and to your team. How can you ensure that those needs are met?
