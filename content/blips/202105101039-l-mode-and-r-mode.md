On [[#stanier-effective-manager](/blips/tags/stanier-effective-manager)], 13th chapter:

Our brain has two modes of processing:
- L-Mode: (L)inear mode, this is the one that does algebra or takes care of focused tasks
- R-Mode:  (R)ich mode, this one is diffuse and out of our control. It takes care of creative thinking, pattern matching and connection making

[[#kahneman-fast-and-slow](/blips/tags/kahneman-fast-and-slow)] defines **R-Mode as system 1** and **L-Mode as system 2**.

PS.: Stanier takes the L/R concept from [[#hunt-pragthinkin](/blips/tags/hunt-pragthinkin)]. Not sure if Hunt took this from somewhere else. So be cautious when attributing authorship here.
