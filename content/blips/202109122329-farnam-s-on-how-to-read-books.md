[[#farnam-how-to-read](/blips/tags/farnam-how-to-read)] exposes a structured way to remember what you read. It's divided in three steps:

1. Active reading - AKA info gathering, making a ritual, link to real life
2. Remembering - AKA take notes and make links
3. Following up - AKA applying to your context, reviewing

There are two points particularly interesting:
