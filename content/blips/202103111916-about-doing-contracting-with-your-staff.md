On your first 1 on 1, you should do something called **contracting**. Contracting consists of collecting the following info:

1. Which areas would you like most support with?
2. How would you like to receive feedback and support?
3. What could be a challenge of us working together?
4. How might we know if the support I'm offering isn't going well?
5. How condifential is the content of our meetings?
