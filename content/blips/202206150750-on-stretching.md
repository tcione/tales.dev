For improving limb movement range. Some general params:

- 5 minutes per group
- 5 times per week (minimum)
- 30 secs of stretching per group seems optimal
- Light warm up beforehand reduces injury risk

Translating this to actionable series:
- Warm up
- Do from 2 to 4 30s repetitions per group per session
- Rest 60s in between repetitions [1]

[#TODO](/tags/TODO): Add a warm up entry
[#TODO](/tags/TODO): add muscle group and stretch examples entry

[1]: There is no definitive research around this topic, but doubling the time you keep stretching seems reasonable
