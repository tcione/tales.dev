There is the question on how to create good upwards communication. It is a good idea to be proactive( the book states this as "pull, don't push"). Top achieve that:

- Understand how your performance as a manager will be evaluated
- Understand how your manager's performance will be evaluated
- Try to understand their world by asking questions related to work, but not directly related to **your work**
- Create weekly summaries with progress, problems, plans and how your staff (people in the book) are fairing
