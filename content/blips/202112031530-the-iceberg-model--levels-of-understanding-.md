[[#harvath-iceberg](/blips/tags/harvath-iceberg)] suggests that [202105111334 Approaching problems with 5 whys](/blips/202105111334-approaching-problems-with-5-whys) come with a few problems, mostly:
- too broad and might be misused (also JP has several types of why, so might be a limitation from the translation)
- "why" has a bunch of cultural implications, many of them negative

He suggests instead that we follow the iceberg model:
1. Gather events 
----- water
2. Observe if the events fit into a trend/pattern
3. Try to identify what make those trends emerge (systemic structures)
4. Check which mental models brought us to those trends (assumptions, beliefs, values, etc)
