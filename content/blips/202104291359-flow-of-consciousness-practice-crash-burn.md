"Crash & Burn" is a form of flow of consciousness built on three tenets:

1. Do not get attached to your ideas
2. Drop the previous idea as soon as a new one pops up
3. Do not stop writing. If stuck, start some sort o enumeration (colors, numbers, movies, countries, etc)

Take 10 minutes to practice that and see where it leads. Do it in conjunction with [202104280825 Homework for life](/blips/202104280825-homework-for-life)
