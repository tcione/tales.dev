The author uses Jell-O as a metaphor about how information trickles down in a company. When it comes from the top, it causes huge waves all around. When bad, it corrodes the company to the core.

The manager should protect their team responsibly by parsing the info and relaying it in a positive way. It is important to highlight that facts musn't be hidden, it's all about getting negative input and directing it towards a productive trajectory (in opposition to a destructive one).
