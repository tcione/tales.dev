This is my first public post under a site I own for a long while (really long, like ten years long). Maintaining a blog is something that I've wanted forever now but never got around to actually make it. The ghost of not writing worthwhile things looms in heavily. It stands to reason that I should wait until I heavy something good, right?

Not really. Waiting on things like this results only in wasted time, so here I am with this timid manifest. Let's hope I can get across this awkward wall I'm under.
