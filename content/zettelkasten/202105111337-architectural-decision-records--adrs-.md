On [[#stanier-effective-manager](/zettelkasten/tags/stanier-effective-manager)], 14th chapter:

To solve the common problem of not knowing why some cryptic piece of code is the way it is, the author suggests using Architectural Decision Records (ADRs for short). In these you should document:
- When the decision was made
- Status of the ADR (proposed, accepted, rejected, superseded, etc)
- Current context and business priorities
- Consequences of the decision

A team could create those and insert a link in comments. To get more examples on ADRs, please go to https://adr.github.io/
