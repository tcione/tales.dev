On [[#stanier-effective-manager](/zettelkasten/tags/stanier-effective-manager)], 11th chapter:

Every project is governed by a balance between scope, resources and time. A manager will have to weight in and manipulate those attributes to be successful in their projects.

Things to consider when thinking about each aspect:

Scope: 
- Break it and categorize its items as "must", "should", "could", "won't" ([MoSCoW method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method))
- Define stretch goals

Time:
- Understand the deadlines. Are those hard deadlines? Is there some lee-ways? Can we get away with approximated dates? Adjust your plan according to these answers.

Resources:
- Can we parallelized tasks?
- How can we optimally deploy our developers without them stepping on each other toes? (keep [202105071145 Brook's Law](/zettelkasten/202105071145-brook-s-law) in mind)
- Do we have the necessary expertise already available?

For all three, consider [202105191357 SCRUM focus on knowledge acquision](/zettelkasten/202105191357-scrum-focus-on-knowledge-acquision)
