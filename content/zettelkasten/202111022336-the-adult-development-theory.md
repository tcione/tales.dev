Developed by [Robert Keagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kegan), it states that people go through 5 stages of development.

1.  The impulsive mind (early childhood)
2. Imperial mind (normally adolescence)
3. Socialized mind (where most of the adult population stays)
	- we experience ourselves as a function of how others experience us.
4. Self-authoring mind
	- we define who we are and no longer negotiate our identity to get acceptance (of course there's still concession, but not on core principles)
5. Self-transforming mind
	- come to accept that we'll always be changing (kind of like the Buddhist idea of constant change). We can free ourselves from us, in a way

[#todo](/zettelkasten/tags/todo) maybe elaborate on stages. This got a bit confusing

Key concepts to understand the stages:
- Transformation is a constant. A lot of our lives is acomodating an ever growing definition of the world ([202111022329 On being an adult](/zettelkasten/202111022329-on-being-an-adult))
-  [202111050047 Subject-Object shift](/zettelkasten/202111050047-subject-object-shift)

Many parts of it sound a whole lot like Stoic principles (i.e, [202105101033 The Stoic Trichotomy of Control](/zettelkasten/202105101033-the-stoic-trichotomy-of-control))

[[#morad-how-to-adult-1](/zettelkasten/tags/morad-how-to-adult-1)] introduced to me the adult development theory, which I came across while writing [202111020016 About leadership](/zettelkasten/202111020016-about-leadership).
