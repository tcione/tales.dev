On [[#stanier-effective-manager](/zettelkasten/tags/stanier-effective-manager)], 10th chapter:

In the chapter, there is a discussion around what to do when performance is DEMANDED from your team. The author uses a project that is taking too long to finish as an example.

This is a tricky subject, as performance is not always a clear cut concept. It is mentioned that it's not rare for senior management to suggest that you should be harsher on your reportees, which is deflected by the author using the [202105061231 Autonomy mastery and purpose](/zettelkasten/202105061231-autonomy-mastery-and-purpose) model.

As a personal side thought, as a Manager, one should strive also to show positive, albeit unseen, outcomes of long winding projects (successful or not). Try to present those as reasons why your team is not slacking off.

On a closing note, the author mentions that we might have to deal with [202105061307 The Dunning-Kruger effect](/zettelkasten/202105061307-the-dunning-kruger-effect) and [202105061317 Impostor syndrome](/zettelkasten/202105061317-impostor-syndrome) in these scenarios, so beware, beware.
