Got from [[#farnam-how-to-read](/zettelkasten/tags/farnam-how-to-read)]

Let go of books when you stop seeing value in them. At this point they are either no longer relevant or have already fulfilled their purpose.

Sometimes you want parts of books, sometimes books could be an article, sometimes you made a bad judgment :)
