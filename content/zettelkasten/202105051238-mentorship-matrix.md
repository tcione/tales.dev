One way to start rocking that mentoring practice in a company is creating a mentorship matrix in which everyone can put their:
- Name
- Job title
- Team
- Contact info
- Skills they want to be mentored in
- Skills they can mentor

As with any political endeavor, please measure the water and get buy in before starting to spread it widely.
