Learning happens in three steps:
1. Something cannot be done
2. Something can be done with assistance
3. Something can be done without assistance

Lev Vygatsky introduced during the 1930s the idea of a **zone of proximal development**. And this is what happens on step (2).

When it comes to work, we can apply this idea at two levels:
- Task: always try to delegate tasks that are on the **zone of proximal development** for your staff
- Career: help people establish steps to achive their goals. The book uses gaming skill trees as an example. Also try to keep steps within the **zone of proximal development**

	[#todo](/zettelkasten/tags/todo) Some things to follow up on:
	- The three steps things reminds me a lot of Feynmans approach to learning
	- The book mentions Jean Piaget theories, I should probably look into those
	- Paulo Freire's work is probably relevant here
