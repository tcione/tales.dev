People might not internalize their achievements, causing them to feel like they did not earn those. This makes them feel a constant fear of being exposed as a "fraud". This is very common and I have no idea on how to avoid it (either for myself or for others).

[[#stanier-effective-manager](/zettelkasten/tags/stanier-effective-manager)] suggests in its 10th chapter that pairing different level people might show them how far they've come. The author also suggests reinforcing good achievements for these people.

[202105051358 Coaching](/zettelkasten/202105051358-coaching) and [202105051235 Mentoring](/zettelkasten/202105051235-mentoring) might also be good tools to deal with that.
