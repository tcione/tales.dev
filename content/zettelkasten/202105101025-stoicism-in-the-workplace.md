The author uses [202105101033 The Stoic Trichotomy of Control](/zettelkasten/202105101033-the-stoic-trichotomy-of-control) to postulate something important about things you have some, but not complete control over. We should set internal goals that are under our control, otherwise we're bound to be frustrated.

I.e.: You shouldn't worry if your current project will be a success, you should make sure you and your team do the best work they can.
