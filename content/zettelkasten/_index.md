Welcome to my digital garden. Here you'll find notes in English and Portuguese (it depends a lot in which language I was reading at the time). I plan to provide a better index (or even better navigation), but for now, a list of notes will do. Enjoy! (and if you'd like to comment on something, feel free to ping me via [email or twitter](/)).
