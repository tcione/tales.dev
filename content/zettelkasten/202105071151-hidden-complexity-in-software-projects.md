Software projects are filled with hidden complexity. The simple act of adding a feature might mess with lots of moving parts. We should strive to uncover this complexity. A good way to go about this is asking questions and rejecting the fear of looking stupid.

- Are there integrations? 
- Do we have to interact with external APIs?
- Do we have experience with this?
- Is the code base well tested?
- Is there a chance for scope changes?
- Are there known unknowns?
- How likely is it for us to find unknown unknowns?
