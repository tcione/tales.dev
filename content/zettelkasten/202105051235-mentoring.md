Mentoring is a relationship in which one party shares what they know with the other party. It consists mostly of a series of *directive* conversations (see [202105051222 Modes of conversation](/zettelkasten/202105051222-modes-of-conversation)).

Mentoring is an opportunity of easing the way into new skills and should always be initiated by the mentee.

For some guidance look into:
