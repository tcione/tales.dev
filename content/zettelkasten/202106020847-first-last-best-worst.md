First, Last, Best, Worst is a a game that's interesting as an exploration tool for stories (also looks like a nice game for travels and team events).

It goes like this:
1. Someone defines a prompt (preferably an interesting one)
2. Everyone says their first, their last, their best and their worst. What depends on the prompt, but humans are awesome pattern matchers
