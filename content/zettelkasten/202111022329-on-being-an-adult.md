Adults have to cope with an ever growing view of the world. They can choose to close themselves or embrace. [202111022336 The Adult Development Theory](/zettelkasten/202111022336-the-adult-development-theory) offers a nice mental model to understand and face the challenges around a ever-more complex world.

Tough questions:
- How do we balance our lives and our evolution?
- Who am I being and is that someone I want to be?
- (When being hasty) Have I really seen that before?
- What's the different perspective I/we/you could have here? see [202111022344 Simple habits for complex times](/zettelkasten/202111022344-simple-habits-for-complex-times)
- What different question could you ask about that (see link above)
