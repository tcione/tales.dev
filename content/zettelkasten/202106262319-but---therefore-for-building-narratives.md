Stories need timing. "But & Therefore Rule" provides a easy way to flesh it out in a dynamic way.

The article provides a spot on example:

> “Jimmy went to the mall, but realized he was tired when he stepped inside. Therefore, he picked up a coffee. But since he was tired, he had parked in an illegal spot. Therefore, by the time he returned to the parking lot, his car had already been towed.”
