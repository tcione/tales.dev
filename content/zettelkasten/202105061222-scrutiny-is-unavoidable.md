On [[#stanier-effective-manager](/zettelkasten/tags/stanier-effective-manager)], 10th chapter:

Scrutiny is unavoidable, so handle it with grace. Approach it with a level head, these things should never be personal. Take a step back to breath if needed.

When receiving scrutiny: measure reactions on your team, try to figure out the root cause and talk it over when appropriate

When practicing scrutiny: take a step back and reason about. Transform the appropriate parts into structured feedback.
