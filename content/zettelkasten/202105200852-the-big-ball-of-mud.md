Defined by [[#brooks-mythicalmm](/zettelkasten/tags/brooks-mythicalmm)], it describe software projects that have grown in an chaotic fashion (which is what happens when you have no design, see [202105191353 Good design vs Bad design](/zettelkasten/202105191353-good-design-vs-bad-design)).

What we usually end up with is a system without clear boundaries and murky interactions. Changing things in it is a dangerous and mind boggling task. It's not rare to see a change cause a chain reaction (which might surface weird bugs).

Preemptive design and solid project concepts are good tactics against this issue. [202105192137 Strategic Design around Domain Driven Design (DDD)](/zettelkasten/202105192137-strategic-design-around-domain-driven-design--ddd-) is a popular approach to that.
