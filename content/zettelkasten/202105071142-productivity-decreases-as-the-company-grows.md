On [[#stanier-effective-manager](/zettelkasten/tags/stanier-effective-manager)], 11th chapter:

Productivity per capta decreases as the company grows. The author cites [202105071145 Brook's Law](/zettelkasten/202105071145-brook-s-law) as a pointer to a good source of info (which is [[#brooks-mythicalmm](/zettelkasten/tags/brooks-mythicalmm)]).

This is a natural process since human coordination is hard and code gets outdated as soon as its deployed. To avert frustration over your team you should:
- Expose [202105071151 Hidden complexity in software projects](/zettelkasten/202105071151-hidden-complexity-in-software-projects)
- Don't be timid about showing progress as it happens
- Practice [202105071130 Software development pragmatism](/zettelkasten/202105071130-software-development-pragmatism)
