There are two categories of things in the world:
1. Things we have control over, such as our inner motivation, desires and actions.
2. Things we have no control over, such as others actions, weather, etc

We should avoid concerning ourselves with things out of our control, there is no point in worrying about them. Focus on what you can do. In case of things out of your control, prepare the best you can and **let it go**.
