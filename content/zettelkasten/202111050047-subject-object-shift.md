Developed by [Robert Keagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kegan) as a part of the [202111022336 The Adult Development Theory](/zettelkasten/202111022336-the-adult-development-theory). Introduced to me by [[#morad-how-to-adult-1](/zettelkasten/tags/morad-how-to-adult-1)]

Subject (I AM) is things we know and are not detachable from us
Object (I HAVE) is things we know, but we can extract, observe, reflect, mold, connect, etc. In other words, we control those things.

[[#morad-how-to-adult-1](/zettelkasten/tags/morad-how-to-adult-1)] uses religion as an example. When your religion is a key part of your identity, this is a subjective property. When you are a person with some religious beliefs, then religion has become an objective property.
