On [[#stanier-effective-manager](/zettelkasten/tags/stanier-effective-manager)], 2nd chapter:

The manager's tools of trade are **the calendar**, **the todo list**, **the email** and **a place to register new information**.

- Keep your **calendar** tidy and **dedicated to things coupled with time periods** (so no reminders or todo items)
- **Register all there is to do in your todo list religiously**. Make a habit out of it and include this in your routine.
- **You email inbox should be your primary means of communication**. Also keep it tidy by archiving things that have been handled. If there is a follow up on those, add them to your todo list
- **Carry with you something to take notes** whenever possible and use it
