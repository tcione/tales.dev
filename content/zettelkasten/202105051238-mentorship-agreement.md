Similar to the idea of [202103111916 About doing contracting with your staff](/zettelkasten/202103111916-about-doing-contracting-with-your-staff), having an agreement with your mentee/mentor might come in handy to establish expectations. The author suggests the following items for the document:

- Time constraints. Does it have a fixed period to happen or is it indefinite? When and how often?
- Flexibility of contact (is it OK to get in contact outside of sessions?)
- Confidentiality. All is private, unless stated otherwise
- Boundaries in the relationship: how far is each party willing to go
- Parameters for reviews and evaluation, so both can see if it's a worthwhile thing to maintain (also opens space for feedback)
- An exit plan in the case in which the mentoring sessions do not click.
