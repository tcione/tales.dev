On [[#stanier-effective-manager](/zettelkasten/tags/stanier-effective-manager)], 12th chapter:

As a manager, you withhold valuable information. You should decide when, how and who to share information with.

There are several examples in the chapter on how to to it, but it boils down to:
- Being consistent
- Being transparent where possible
- Articulate politics in a positive way
- [202105051218 Building your network within a company](/zettelkasten/202105051218-building-your-network-within-a-company)

In essence:
1. Do no harm
2. Think of other people (don't do to other what you wouldn't like done to you)
