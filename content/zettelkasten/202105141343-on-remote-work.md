Remote working is an unavoidable tendency (specially after the global pandemic during 2020/2021). The book offers some advice on how to make it optimal:
- In a hybrid setup, make sure that the meeting has a proper setup for the remote workers. Ideally, each participant will have their own camera.
- In a hybrid setup, make sure that you allow space for remote participants to talk. Also avoiding talking over the other people, that's hard for remote participants to hear
- Communicate in writing as much as possible
- Assume async coordination at all times. Schedule something when sync mode is needed
- Trust that your coworkers will do their job :)
