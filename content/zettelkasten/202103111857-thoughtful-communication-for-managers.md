One should be thoughtful about communication. Remember to:
- Choose the proper medium for your messages
- Be consistent across media
- Adapt your message to the person or group receiving the message
- Be as direct and concise as you can be when providing #feedback
- Be aware of your emotions and adjust accordingly (i.e., ask for more time before a meeting or make a disclosure of your mental state beforehand)
