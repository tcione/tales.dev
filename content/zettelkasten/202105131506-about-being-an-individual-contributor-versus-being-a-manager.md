It comes a time in a software developer's career that they have to choose between two options in their [202105131455 Dual career ladder](/zettelkasten/202105131455-dual-career-ladder): being an individual contributor or a manger. Here are what being each of these mean for me:

- Individual contributors (ICs) are in charge of developing features, making architectural decisions, mentoring other developers and being big influencers when it comes to technical decisions
- Managers are in charge of guaranteeing that their team operates well and have positive outcomes. Managers are also in charge of their team members well being and development. [[#stanier-effective-manager](/zettelkasten/tags/stanier-effective-manager)] is all about being a manager, but here are some useful pointers:
