Book: Become an Effective Software Engineering Manager (1st edition) by Dr. James Stanies

My unorganized notes: [blips#stanier-effective-manager](/blips/tags/stanier-effective-manager)

The book covers a lot of ground, so it sets itself to only give brief introductions to all the topics that should be relevant to an engineering manager. It does a wonderful job at that.
