my name is Tales<sup>1</sup>. Nice to have you here :). I've been living in Berlin for the past few years, but I'm originally from SÃ£o Paulo (Brazil).

I'm currently the Engineering Manager for the Recruiter Portal team at [HeyJobs](https://www.heyjobs.co/en-de). Previously I've worked as backend developer for the same company.

Before that, I've worked for 5 years as the tech lead (and co-founder) at a software consultancy called [Levante](https://web.archive.org/web/20170829170647/http://42i.com.br/).

Even before that, I've worked as a full-stack developer and tech lead for a digital ad agency called Coworkers.

Outside of work I hang out with my family (wife, baby and [dog](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DluJcH-WwAg8iT_?format=jpg&name=small)). I like reading magical realism (but I'm open to all kinds of books). I love the Atlantic Ocean, and I'm trying to do better at exercises (which is hard).

If you are curious on how it would be to work with me, check out ["Me as a manager"](/about/me-as-a-manager). If you'd like to chat a bit, you can reach out through the following places:
